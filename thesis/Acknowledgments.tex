I wish to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Yoichi Sato for his constant support and patience throughout my Master's study and research.
Without his invaluable guidance and persistent encouragement, this thesis would not have been possible. I will always feel indebted to him for the opportunity to study at his laboratory.

Besides my advisor, I would also like to pay my special regards to the staff members in our lab, Yusuke Matsui, Ryo Yonetani and Keita Higuchi who helped me greatly with my research and I owe my appreciation for their continuous assistance. Their insightful advice and comments have been extremely important to my studies.

I would like to thank my fellow labmates from the bottom of my heart for the time we spent together. Not only have I benefited from the illuminating discussions and talks, but I have also enjoyed your friendship and I will always remember the happy memories and all the fun we have had in the past few years.

Finally, my deep and sincere gratitude to my beloved family for their continuous and unparalleled love and support. None of this would have been possible without them. I am forever indebted to my family for everything they have done for me. I love you dearly.
